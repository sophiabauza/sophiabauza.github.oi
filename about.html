	<h1> Sophia Bauza</h1>
	
	<p> I am very fun of the variety of colors. My love for art started at the beginning of my senior year of high school. Is been a journey but this is just the beginning. The most important this is the support of your family and friends. I’m a 21 year old Graphic and Web design student at the Miami International University of art and design. 
I was born in Havana, Cuba. My mom is been supportive from the beginning and I’m grateful for all her hard work. In 2010 I move to the U.S and I went straight to Syracuse, NY. There I learn English and how school worked. After three years there I moved to Miami, Florida and I been living here seen then. 
I have worked with every Adobe program such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Etc. I am accessible   to work in any creative development like murals, illustration, photography and more.
